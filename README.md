## 💡 Why This Journey?

I'm documenting my transition from IT Support Engineer to Solutions Architect to build a portfolio of real AWS projects. Theory and certifications open doors, but hands-on building gets you through them. 

**The Goal:** Land an SA L5 or TAM L4 role by demonstrating I can architect solutions, build them, and communicate technical decisions to stakeholders.

**Current Role:** IT Support Engineer at Amazon ($70K/year)  
**Target Role:** Solutions Architect / TAM ($110-130K)  
**Personal Motivation:** Financial security to propose to my girlfriend and buy our first house together
